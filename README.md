Lua script permissions for Garry's Mod.

## Project Plan
### Basic concept
This primary idea is to detour classifiable "scary" methods and allow a server 
administrator or user to either be prompted for access to said methods or whitelist
certain methods.  

### Structure
- [ ] `PermissionsManager`
  - [ ] `Permission[]` -
      Responsible for 
  - [ ] `PermissionResolver`
